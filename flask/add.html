from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

todos = []

@app.route('/todos', methods=['POST'])
def create_todo():
    data = request.get_json()
    if 'task' in data:
        task = data['task']
        todos.append(task)
        return jsonify({'message': 'Todo created successfully'}), 201
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing task parameter'}), 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)


In this example, we define a Flask app with one route (/todos) that accepts POST requests for creating todos. When a POST request is made to this endpoint with a JSON payload containing a "task" field, it adds the task to the "todos" list and returns a JSON response indicating success. If the "task" field is missing, it returns a 400 Bad Request response.

Remember to install Flask if you haven't already:


pip install Flask


You can test this endpoint by sending a POST request with a JSON payload like:


{
    "task": "Buy groceries"
}


This is a simple example, and you can expand upon it to include additional functionality such as listing, updating, or deleting todos as nee
